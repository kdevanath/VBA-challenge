# VBA-challenge
#TickerAnalysis.bas contains the logic for calculating
# % Price change for each ticker for the year
# total volume for the year
# Finding the stock that moved the most in either  #direction  
# the most traded by volume
# Screen shot files are 2016,2015 and 2014
# Using the Range.Find is very cumbersome. Does not #work well with large numbers and Formatted columns.
